CSC: Circular Sequence Comparison
===

GNU GPLv3 License; Copyright (C) 2015 Solon P. Pissis, Ahmad Retha and Fatima Vayani.

Given two sequences x and y, CSC finds the cyclic rotation of x (or an approximation of it) 
that minimises the blockwise q-gram distance from y.

To compile CSC, please follow the instructions given in file INSTALL.
